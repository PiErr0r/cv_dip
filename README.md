# Computer vision and Digital image processing

## Literature

- Computer Vision Algorithms and Applications by Richard Szeliski
- Digital image processing by Gonzalez, Rafael C. Woods, Richard E.
- Digital Image Processing, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg by Professor Dr. Bernd JÃ¤hne

## TODO

- matrix wrapper for image data
- use DevTools as REPL to interact with image in real time
  - engine for displaying image in new canvas (similar to Matlab figure)
- use images available in imgs as picker
- allow user to add new image
- maybe in the future use some kind of mw to save the workspace and create custom REPL
- architect the separation of modules (algorithms)
- some ml/dl as specified in Szelinski book

Additional necessary stuff:
- complex algebra
- matrix/vector algebra (with complex nums support)
- fft/ifft (test with polynome multiplication, compare with naive n^2 solution)
- noises (gaussian statistics, salt & pepper)
- other statistics functions (correlation, variance, covariance, expectation, histograms - )
- dithering at some point
